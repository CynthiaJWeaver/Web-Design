        <h1>My Practice Blog</h1>
        <h2>Why hike the Appalachian Trail?</h2>
        <p>The Appalachial Trail has called to me since I first read about it in 1991, and idea of through-hiking it has been like a siren song to me. 
            Life and other things happened, and my hiking adventures were postponed for a few decades.<br> <br>In June, 2019, my sister (Sherry), my brother (Mike) 
            and I set out for a trial run, or trial hike, of the A.T. My brother, Mike, had two weeks of vacation in which to hike, but my Sherry and I (both teachers)
            had planned to hike four weeks. We had hiked for 5 days, when Sherry fell and sustained a knee injury. We left the trail at Mountain Crossing, Georgia,
            and had a doctor check out her knee. The conclusion was that she was banned from the Appalachian Trail for that summer. <br><br> We decided to regroup and 
            plan for our through-hike beginning in the Spring of 2022. Although our journey was short in 2019, we learned a few things about what we will need 
            physically and mentally to successfully though-hike. First of all, Sherry will wear her knee brace, and second, we will carry less food--restocking 
            frequently is possible on the A.T.<br><br>There may be as many different reasons to through-hike the A.T as there are different types of hiking shoes. 
            For me, I believe that the extended time spent experiencing the natural world and the act of challenging my physical endurance beyond any challenge previously faced
            will bring me to a place of knowing and accepting who I am in this world. Plus, ccomplishing my through-hiking goal will leave the way open for the next big 
            adventure!

        <p>Continually using the word "practice"as I work on coding and learning to create a webpage is important for
            me. As long as I remind myself that I'm practicing and that these are not finished products, I can try new
            things and be more creative. </p>
