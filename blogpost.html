        <h2>Why hike the Appalachian Trail?</h2>
        <p>The Appalachial Trail has called to me since I first read about it in 1991,
            and idea of through-hiking it has been like a siren song to me. </p>
        <h2>I'm practicing coding using HTML and in-line styling.</h2>
        <p>Continually using the word "practice"as I work on coding and learning to create a webpage is important for
            me. As long as I remind myself that I'm practicing and that these are not finished products, I can try new
            things and be more creative. </p>
