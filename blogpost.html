        <h2>Why hike the Appalachian Trail?</h2>
        <p>The Appalachial Trail has called to me since I first read about it in 1991, and idea of through-hiking it has
            been like a siren song to me. </p>

    <h2>I'm Learning to code using HTML.</h2>
    <p>Continually using the word "practice" as I work on coding and learning to create a webpage is important for me.
        As long as I remind myself that I'm practicing and that these are not finished products, I can try new things
        and be more creative.
